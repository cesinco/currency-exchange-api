    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any interest in collecting data about historical exchange rates, you may have accessed some websites that can offer this type of data. For example, [oanda.com](https://www.oanda.com/currency-converter/en/?from=CAD&to=USD&amount=1) is one that can be used to perform this task, however there is no API available (only for institutional clients, and probably paid access only). There are a host of others that offer paid access, but one that is relatively easy to use and offers free access (limited to 5,000 requests per month) is [currencyscoop.com](https://currencyscoop.com/api-documentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the free access does not provide the ability to query a timeseries - you can query individual dates historically but each will only return one day of values. Timeseries queries are only available at the membership level that at the time of this writing cost $99 per month. Still, we can build our own timeseries if we don't mind making 5,000 request maximum per month. Another restriction on the free account is that the base currency cannot be changed from USD, although you can always do some conversion from one currency to another to form your base currency as a workaround.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will probably need to know how to specify the currencies for your particular solution, and all of the currencies supported are listed on [https://currencyscoop.com/supported-currencies](https://currencyscoop.com/supported-currencies)"

    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "You must request an API key from [currencyscoop.com](https://currencyscoop.com/signup). The process is straightforward - simply your name, and email address and a password are required. Once you create your account, your API key will be displayed on the Account Details section of the page. This is the only requirements you need to create the request.\n",
